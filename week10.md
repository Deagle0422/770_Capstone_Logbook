# Week 10
May 7, 2025
- Finalise the endpoint connection with the frontend
- Test with the frontend to ensure every single endpoint works and data are correctly transfered
- Test the connection with the firmware to ensure that data can be pass from rasperry pico to backend, but currently we have some issue receiving the data

Next Week:
- A little more endpoint requested by the frontend to make some advanced visualisation of data
- More work towards the firmware backend connection that ensures data are send and recieved correctly with good accuracy
