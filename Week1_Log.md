# Week1
Wednesday 5th March
## Objectives
* Met with the team and get to know each other
* Met the Mentor
* Establish initial communication channels
* Begin initial planning for project tasks, starting with Risk Analysis.
## Notes and Observations
* Team members introduced themselves; diverse skill sets observed (e.g., frontend/backend, electrical, management, documentation)
* Mentor gave a brief overview of expectations and deliverables
* Discord channel was created for communication and collaboration
## Design Ideas
* Discord chosen for communication due to its flexibility with voice, text, and file sharing (https://discord.gg/qdwcYd8q)
## Reflections
* Good to meet the team and mentor in a relaxed setting
* A future task could be establishing a shared folder (e.g., Google Drive or Notion) for centralized document management
## Next Steps
* Wait for detailed project requirements from mentor/client
* Assign roles within the team based on individual strengths
* Begin preliminary Risk Analysis once project scope is received
* Schedule next team meeting
