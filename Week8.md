# Week 8
May 7, 2025
- Continue on some more endpoints of "GET" operation that will help the frontend better display the information

Next Week:
- We found that as long as we connect the frontend, backend and firmware, the telemetry data need one more primary key other than the ECU id to correctly save to the database table, so we decide to make some change to the database schema. I will try to edit the database model to implement the change.
