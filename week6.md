# Week 6
April 7, 2025
## Objectives
* Continue developing additional backend endpoints to cover remaining models
* Work on project proposal: draft supporting graphs and write explanatory content
## Notes and Observations
* Backend endpoints were expanded to support more models, likely including Event, Competition, and possibly Score and Entries
* Graphs and diagrams (e.g., system architecture, data flow) were prepared for inclusion in the proposal document
* Wrote initial draft of paragraphs for project background and backend implementation details
## Design Ideas
* Consider using Django’s ModelViewSet for more concise route handling
* Graphs created include:

## Outstanding Issues
* Proposal not finalized — pending content reviews and final formatting
* Frontend and firmware not yet connected to the backend; integration testing pending
## Reflections
* Balanced technical development with documentation work this week
* Proposal writing helped clarify and document the system's architecture, which is useful for all team members
## Next Steps
* Finalize the proposal: clean up paragraphs, double-check diagrams, and format references
* Begin integrating frontend and firmware with backend APIs
* Consider writing a short internal API documentation for teammates
